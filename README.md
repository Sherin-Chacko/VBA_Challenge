### 1. OVERVIEW OF PROJECT : 
The purpose of this challenge is to refactor the VBA code from Module 2 solution and to measure its performance by analyzing the script run-times of the original    script and the refactored script for the different stocks of the year 2017 and 2018.       

The dataset includes two spreadsheets with information on 12 different stocks. The stock information contains a ticker value, the date the stock was issued, the opening, closing and adjusted closing price, the highest and lowest price, and the volume of the stock. The goal is to retrieve the ticker, the total daily volume, and the return on each stock.
